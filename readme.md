# Mapping Flows of Benefits of MES Across the Globe

This is a Geovisualization research project the Master's in Geo-information Science and Earth Observations for Geoinformatics. 
An interactive web mapping application has been built to visualize the flows of economic benefits of Marine Ecosystem Services (MES).
The visualization specifically shows the economic benefits of tuna fish from the purse seine fishery within the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) Region. 
									
The aim of the application is to interactively visualize, explore and understand the flows of benefits of MES across the world.
The ultimate goal of such an application is to produce an adaptable approach of mapping other global supply value chains, or ES flows of  similar characteristics.
								

The data used in this visualize is obtained from the Pacific Possible Project report by World Bank and Nicholas Institute.
We provide a new approach of communicating the baseline data in the report focusing on the steps in the global value supply chain as demonstrated below.

## Features
- The overview page allows users to see 3 visualization: A sankey diagram, barchart, and flow map.
- Users can view distribution (choropleth) maps and switch between views by clicking on the mapview buttons.
- User can get more information and functionality pn the side navigation bar including: about, search, help and information.
- Users can also explore the application interactively through search, buttons, mouse hovers and clicks.
